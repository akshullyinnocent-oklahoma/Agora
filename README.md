Official LLM apps are often heavily restricted, wrapping capable AI models in sanitized, linear, and limited user interfaces. **Agora is different.**

Agora is a fully open-source, BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) Android client designed for power users who want raw, unrestricted access to frontier models. Built natively with Jetpack Compose, it brings desktop-class agentic capabilities to your mobile device, emphasizing user control, privacy, and architectural flexibility.

## Why Agora?

- **No Middlemen:** You connect directly to the API provider. There are no intermediary servers, no hidden telemetry, and no corporate tracking logging your conversations. Your chat history lives locally on your device.
- **Non-Linear Thought:** Human conversation isn't a straight line, and AI interactions shouldn't be either. Agora uses a tree-structured database that allows you to edit past messages, regenerate responses, and seamlessly explore alternative conversation branches without losing your original context.
- **Agentic Workflows:** Native support for tool calling, web search, code execution, memory management, and on-device LLM inference — all directly in the chat interface.

## Features

### Multi-Provider Access
- **8 built-in AI providers** plus custom provider support: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen (DashScope), OpenRouter, Ollama, and on-device Local (GGUF via llama.cpp)
- **Custom providers:** Define arbitrary provider names with custom base URLs and API keys
- **BYOK:** Bring your own API keys for every provider — no subscriptions, no middlemen
- Per-provider base URL override for proxies and self-hosted endpoints
- **Multiple API keys per provider** with named aliases for easy rotation

### Agentic Capabilities
- **Tool Calling:** Multi-round tool execution loop — the model can search the web, read/write memory files, search past conversations, execute shell commands, and more
- **Web Search:** Built-in Brave, Serper, Tavily, and SearXNG integration. The model decides when to search and the app executes it client-side
- **Code Execution:** Gemini code execution support for running and testing code inline
- **Remote Shell Execution:** Execute shell commands on remote servers via configurable shell devices with SSH-like access
- **Active Memory:** Persistent context carried across conversations — the model can store and recall information between chats
- **Saved Memory Files:** Model-created and managed markdown files for long-term knowledge storage
- **Granular Context Access Controls:** Independently toggle the model's access to past conversations, saved memories, and active memory

### Thinking & Reasoning
- Deep support for reasoning models across providers (OpenAI o1/o3, Anthropic extended thinking, Gemini thinking, DeepSeek-R1, Qwen QwQ, OpenRouter reasoning)
- Configurable thinking level per model (low/medium/high) for fine-grained control over reasoning depth
- Streaming think-tag parser renders thought chains in real-time with collapsible UI
- Thinking duration tracking for performance analysis

### On-Device Intelligence
- **Local LLM inference** via llama.cpp — run GGUF models entirely on-device with no network
- **Local embeddings** for on-device semantic search (RAG) over your conversation history
- **Ollama** provider for self-hosted models on your local network

### Knowledge Management
- **RAG-powered semantic search** across all past conversations using cosine similarity
- Configurable similarity threshold and keyword/model search methods
- Selectable embedding model (remote or local) independent of chat model
- **Context window management** with real-time token counting and configurable sliding window
- Visual context rollout indicator dims messages outside the active window

### Data Portability
- **.agora Export/Import:** Export conversations, memories, prompts, settings, and API keys to a single portable file
- **Merge, Replace, and Skip import strategies** for flexible data restoration
- **Third-Party Import:** Import chat history from Claude and ChatGPT exports (.zip or .json)
- API key safety warnings for both export and import workflows

### Customization
- **System prompt templates** with three-section editor (system prompt + user prepend + user append)
- Variable substitution: `{sent_time}`, `{sent_date}`, and future-proof variable system
- Per-conversation model and system prompt switching on the fly
- Per-message model selection from the chat bottom bar
- **Auto title generation** with configurable model selection

### UI & UX
- Modern Material 3 design built entirely in Jetpack Compose
- **Non-linear branching:** Edit any past message and branch into alternative conversation paths
- Real-time streaming with precise message anchoring and animated auto-scrolling
- Immersive gesture-driven image viewer
- Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting, LaTeX math, and code block support
- Image, video, and file attachment support with thumbnails
- English and Chinese (中文) language support

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (Ladybug or newer recommended)
- Android SDK 34+
- A valid API key from a supported provider (Google Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/newo-ether/Agora.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Sync the project with Gradle files.
4. Build and run the app on an emulator or a physical Android device.

### Configuration

1. Launch Agora on your device.
2. Open **Settings** from the bottom navigation bar.
3. Select a **Provider** and add your **API Key**.
4. Browse and enable models under **Models** → "Sync from All Providers."
5. Customize system prompts, context limits, web search, and memory settings to your preference.

### Running Local Models

1. Place a GGUF model file on your device.
2. In Settings → Provider → Local, tap "Import GGUF Model" and select the file.
3. Configure context size, temperature, and other parameters.
4. Select your local model from the chat model picker.
